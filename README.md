# Music-Player
Project Outline
Basic Music Player

Our team will be creating a music player that will have the ability to 
    Search music
    Go to the next or previous song
    Repeat the list of songs
    Add to a playlist
    See an album, including the title, artist, year, and tracklist
    Show the lyrics
The data structure used in this project will include a doubly linked list, allowing the user to go to the “next” or “previous” songs and add a new song to a playlist/album. Stacks will also be used, which will be used to show that the last song has played. Finally, queues will be used throughout the project, which will allow the player to repeat the list of songs again once they have reached the last song.
