My Side
Ay now tell me real get back, this ain't no rap shit
You know what I'm sayin,
My side different from these niggas, you know?
I told YoungBoy, this gon' be the perfect one
Set us apart from these niggas, we finna set the bar, you know?
Where I'm from it ain't safe boy it's wild
Keep a gun cuz I gotta survive
Nigga better not come tweak on my side
Nigga know all my niggas gon' ride
Fuck who you is, give a fuck where you from
Nigga ain't comin' around in dat North
Fuck all that shit nigga I don't want talk
Where ever we at we gon shoot it out
I'm up in the hills and I just got house
Come where you at know you stay witch yo dawg
Don't shoot out the window hop out spill rounds
Hit everybody we gon wipe him out
[?] I gotta look out
I got 12 grams stuffed in a raw
Whole lotta guns up in this fuckin' car
Whole lotta fire ya we gon take em out
You been talkin' too reckless yo business on insta
I won't respond that ain't what I'm bout
Imma just keep it steady rockin' shows
I'm steady keep on drivin these cars
Where I'm from it ain't safe boy it's wild
Keep a gun cuz I gotta survive
Nigga bet not come tweak on my side
Nigga know all my niggas gon' ride
Lil' nigga, we used to roll with some motercats
Had macs in the trenches like shoulder straps
Shoot at me, on your head, put twenty racks
Where your money at? Why you get over stretched?
All my niggas off drugs, on stronger acts
I won't change, I'm the same, I'm sober [??]
I just bought a brick and it cost a Patek
And if I say it's smoke, then they know it's stacked
My side, my side, that's Lamron
From the part of the city, they scam hard
You would sell your own momma heroin (let's get it)
The kids that you raised they'll blam some
Ran off on the plug through a Samsung
Feds tapping all the Iphones
Goons lurking like a plies song
Get it right before you die wrong
Where I'm from it ain't safe boy its wild
Keep a gun cuz I gotta survive
Nigga better not come twerk on my side
Nigga know all my niggas gon' ride
